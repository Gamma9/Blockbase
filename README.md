# Blockbase

A blockchain marketplace where users can scroll through to see what accomplishment or task they have to achieve to receive the reward.
Ex: 500,000 Rt's on a tweet about The Dallas Mavericks basketball team, in exchange for season tickets for 1 year.

## Personal

A list of 25 items that you personally want to complete in a 5 year period, that we or partnering sponsors approve, and you can receive a reward if you complete all 25 items on your list. They have to based off of your personal interests and hobbies. They have to serious projects or trips, not just easy weekend activities. Maybe have a timer or something you can start when you're about to start the activity. Think of this as like a short-term to medium-term bucket list. Would want to be able to score discounts for partnering companies, like AirBnB, Hotels, Uber/Lyft, Six Flags, Dallas Cowboys, LISD, etc. that would cut deals for users that are currently active in an accomplishment off their list.

## Public

The public blockchain marketplace where you can see a list of achievements to try to accomplish, in exchange for a corresponding reward.
